[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

Cohen's d for birth weight of first babies vs others is -.08867 standard deviations.  This difference is minor but shows a slight tendency towards first babies being smaller than other birth order babies.  This shows a somewhat stronger indication of difference than the difference in pregnancy length but it is similarly not very significantly large.
